    <p><b>Dear Nilesh Dude,</b><br><br>

        Tomorrow in particular (it's National Best Friend Day!), I want to thank you for everything you have done. When I say that, I mean it with every bone in my body because you really mean the world to me. Sometimes I wonder how I ever got so lucky to meet a person like you. I can’t seem to pinpoint the exact moment our friendship began, but it is crazy to think about how in that moment, everything changed. Since then, we have been there for each other through the good and the bad (and the really bad). I hope everyone has someone like you in their life. <br><br>
        
       <b> Thank you for</b> giving me the most amazing advice. Whether I need some major boy help. With completely sincerity, I trust every piece of guidance you have given me. <br><br>
        
        <b>Thank you for</b> always being honest with me. It may not seem like it, but I appreciate it when you tell me I am overreacting, or that my hair is a mess. It’s not every day you find a friend that will tell you what you really need to hear. <br><br>
        
       <b> Thank you for</b> always being there for me, through thick and thin. I can count on you for everything, whether it's liking my latest Instagram pic or WhatsApp status. Through the many fights with my mom, the heartbreak disasters and the ridiculous drama with other friends, you have always known how to cheer me up. You make me realize that while my problems seem like the end of the world, next week they will not even matter. <br><br>
        
       <b> Thank you for </b> making me a better person. I know that I have become a kinder, smarter and overall happier person since meeting you. I think throughout our friendship we have learned a lot from each other. <br><br>
        
      <b>  Thank you for</b> making so many of my memories ones that will last forever. Our Call  and Message have been epic, but our movie Shareing are just as special to me. Just thinking about the times we sang at the top of our lungs to our favorite songs, makes me smile. Remember all those LOL worthy moments that literally  I will never forget them. <br><br>
        
       <b> Lastly, thank you for </b> putting up with me. Somehow you have never given up on me, no matter how ridiculous I can get. You never judge me when I talk about the same boy over and over .<br><br>
        
       I am so grateful Because I got You as a best Friend. <br><br>
        
    
        Your best friend <br>
